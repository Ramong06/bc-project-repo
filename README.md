# bc-project-repo

*Repo for changes I make in homework 1 assigned by Bootcamp.*

First changes that were made was to eliminate as many <div> tags as possible and replace them with semantic tags.

Next change was to section out the different sections and article tags and space everything so that it would be more legible to someone viewing the code. 

Next changes were to add alt attributes to the <img> tags. 

Before every change I made I used <!--Notes--> to identy every section of the web page to make it easy to understand for someone who has never looked at code before.
